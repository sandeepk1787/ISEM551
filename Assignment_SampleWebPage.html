            <p>This course is an introduction to web-based software engineering environments, design patterns, frameworks and key architectural aspects of robust enterprise applications. Topics for software development technologies include development languages and frameworks (e.g., .NET, NodeJS, Java, open-source), various tools used during the development lifecycle, and key components of an application in terms of the data, process and presentation layers. The emphasis is on hands-on software development in JavaScript (MEAN stack), C# and other programming languages in modern software engineering environments. This is a handâ€™s on application development course that introduces the latest web technologies, methodologies, libraries, and program languages used in open source and commercial applications - today. The purpose of this course is to actively engage the students by helping them to work on projects and assignments. The course is divided into four modules. &nbsp;
